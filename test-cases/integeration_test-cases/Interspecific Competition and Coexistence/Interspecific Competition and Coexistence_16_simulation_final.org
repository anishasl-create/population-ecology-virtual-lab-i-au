* Objective
  - To view ,the simulator of Interspecific Competition and Coexistence experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/population-ecology-virtual-lab-i-au/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Interspecific Competition and Coexistence/Interspecific Competition and Coexistence_01_Usability_smk.org][Interspecific Competition and Coexistence_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. Select the two species.
  5. Input the values for initial population, rate of growth, carrying capacity, theta value, alpha value, number of steps and step size for both the species, species1 and species 2.
  6. Click on the step run button to start the step.
  7. Click on the run iteration to start the iteration.
  8. Click on the pause button to pause the iteration.
  9. Click on the reset button to reset the experiment.
  
* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk charactersthe 
  4. Result Graphs should be displayed on the screen.
  5. Statitics of population of species 1 and species 2 are shown.
  6. Graph will plot with density of population of species 1 and species 2.
  5. When we click on the reset button, the graphs displayed on the screen should be erased and It should redirect to the simulation home  page
